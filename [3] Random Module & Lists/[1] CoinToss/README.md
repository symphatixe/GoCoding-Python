# Coin Toss
The purpose of this task is to simulate a coin toss, using the `random module` to see if it's tails or heads.

### Skills
- Use the `import` keyword to use external libraries and understand what it does.
- Use `lower()` globally to make sure user input is accurately tracked.
- Check that the input matches the choices, instead of a random text and use the `exit()` function to stop the program from running.
- Learn how to use shorthand or ternary conditions which are typically used for binary conditions as we discussed before in using if and else.
- Reinforce the usage of match, by giving it two parameters and using two parameter cases.
