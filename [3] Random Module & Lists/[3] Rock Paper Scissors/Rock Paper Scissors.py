#TODO Create a variable that stores the computer's choice and the user's choice taking an int
#TODO Just like the coin toss program, create a variable to store the string representation of both choices (rock, paper, scissors)
# Use match case for this
#TODO Create a match case conditional for the outcomes of the choices, include complex ternary operators for printing different text
# based on the choices
#TODO Inside the cases for the match use guard conditions to specify what input is going to be printed out and use wildcards
