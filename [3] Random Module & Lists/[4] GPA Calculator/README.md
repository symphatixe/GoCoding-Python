# GPA Calculator
The purpose of this task is to understand what lists are and how we can use them as well as most of the functions related to them.

### Skills
- Understand how to create `lists` and access them using `indexes`.
- Get the total and average of a list without using a `loop`.
- Use `round()` on the average to prevent an unreadable decimal.
- Use `insert()`, `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()` functions and recalculate the total and average based on list modifications.
- In the use of the `insert()` function explain the different `parameters` that can be used.
- Use `f-strings` to print out the `list` as it is updated and the average.
