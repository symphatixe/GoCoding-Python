# Starter Code
grades = [90, 60, 90, 40, 50, 100, 70, 40]


# Write your code below!


# TODO Complete the tasks below!
"""
» Print out the list of grades using an f-string and introduce the user to the program
» Calculate the average of all grades in the list using indexing, round to 2 decimal places
    › Note: as we are working with ints, cast as a float because there will be no decimals
» You take a test and receive 100 on it, use append() to add it to the list
» You missed the 2nd test and received a 85, use insert() to add it
» Use remove() to take away the duplicate grade of a 40, and also pop() to remove the other 40 as well
» Pick a grade to remove using pop() with an index
» Recalculate the average and print out the final grade using an f-string
