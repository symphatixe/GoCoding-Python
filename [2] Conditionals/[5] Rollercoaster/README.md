# Rollercoaster
The purpose of this task is to create a rollercoaster application to calculate a total bill based on user input.

### Skills
- Use `conditionals` to change user interaction and create `nested conditionals` within them. 
- Use `booleans` to indicate some condition and use them within `conditional` statements.
- Using a `global` counter variable to calculate the total.
- Use `exit()` to make sure the user enters the correct data.
- Encapsulating `conditionals` efficiently.
- Setting `lower()` globally on variables to avoid repeating code.
- Print out the total using a `f-string`.
