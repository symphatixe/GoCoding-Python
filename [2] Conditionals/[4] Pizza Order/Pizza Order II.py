# input() must be placed in between the print() statements to print them out during execution, instead of at the end

#TODO Create a variable that stores the total
#TODO Create a set of conditionals to check the size and add it according to the comments, and print out text
#TODO Create an input field for pepperoni (add_pepperoni = input("Do you want pepperoni? Y or N \n")
#TODO Create a set of conditionals to check whether the pepperoni is added, add it according to the comments, and print out text
#TODO Create an input field for extra cheese (extra_cheese = input("Do you want extra cheese? Y or N \n")
#TODO Create a condition to check whether the cheese is correctly added, adding it according to the comments and print out the text
#TODO Create else for pepperoni and cheese conditionals to inform the user that they chose to not add extra cheese or pepperoni
#TODO Print the total using an f-string

TODO Extra for this version
- Create simple exceptions using else and exit() to stop the program running
- Use lower() on the input() to set it globally
