# TODO Complete the tasks below!
"""
» Create a variable to store the total.
» Use the data below to complete the conditionals for the program:
    ⇒ Size
        › Small pizza is $15.
        › Medium pizza is $20.
        › Large pizza is $25.
    ⇒ Pepperoni
        › Small size addition is $2.
        › Medium and large size addition is $3.
    ⇒ Extra cheese
        › $1 across all sizes.

» Use else statements with exit() so that the program stops running when there are errors.
» Use lower() for all input() statements.
» Print out the total bill using an f-string.

» See if you can optimize the pepperoni conditional by making it shorter and using nested conditionals.
