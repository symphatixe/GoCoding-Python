# Starter Code
print("Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!")
size = input("What size pizza do you want? S, M, or L \n").lower()


# Write your code below!
# small is $15, medium is $20, large is $25
# pepperoni is $2 for small, $3 for medium and large
# extra cheese is $1 for all sizes
# input() must be placed in between the print() statements to print them out during execution, instead of at the end

#TODO Create a variable to store the total
#TODO Create a set of conditionals to check the size and add it according to the comments, and print out text
#TODO Create an input field for pepperoni and set it to be lowercase using lower()
#TODO Create a set of conditionals to check whether the pepperoni is added, add it according to the comments, and print out text (using and & or)
#TODO Create an input field for extra cheese and set it to be lowercase using lower()
#TODO Create a condition to check whether the cheese is correctly added, adding it according to the comments and print out the text
#TODO Create else for pepperoni and cheese conditionals to inform the user that they chose to not add extra cheese or pepperoni
#TODO Print the total using an f-string
