# Pizza Order
The purpose of this task is to use user input to create a pizza order and print out the total bill.

### Skills
- Understand the implementation of user input within a program and updating a global variable.
- There are 2 solutions that cover different aspects of programming such as:
  - using multiple `conditionals` and printing by interweaving `input()` in between `print()` statements.
  - using a `global` counter variable to calculate the total.
  - use `exit()` to make sure the user enters the correct data.
  - encapsulating conditionals efficiently.
  - setting `lower()` globally on variables to avoid repeating code.
  - printing out the total using a `f-string`.
