# TODO Complete the tasks below!
"""
» Combine the two names and lowercase them into one variable.
» Create a friend_count variable to store the amount of friend letters in the names.
» Use the count() function to figure out how many of each letter are in the names.
» Copy the same logic for the ship_count variable and find how many of each letter are in the names.
» Calculate the total friendship score
    › Concatenate the two scores into one
    › For example:
        friend = 3
        ship = 5
        score = 35 not 8
    › Make sure to cast it as an int so that it can be used as a number
» Create a set of conditionals to determine how good as friends you are
    › Friendship scores less than 10 or greater than 90, are super friends
    › Friendship scores greater than or equal to 40 or less than or equal 50 are alright friends
    › Otherwise print the score using an f-string
