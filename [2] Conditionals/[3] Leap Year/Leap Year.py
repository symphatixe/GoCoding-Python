"""
» Create three booleans to store whether the year is a leap year based on how divisible it is.
» Using conditionals, check if the year is a leap year or not:
    › If the year is not divisible by 4 it is not a leap year
    › if the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, it is a leap year
    › if the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400, it is not a leap year
    › if the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 and divisible by 400, it is a leap year
