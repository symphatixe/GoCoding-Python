# Friendship Calculator
The purpose of this task is to calculate the friendship score between two names based on an arbitrary scale of counting how many times each letter from "true friendship" appears within the two names. Scores greater than 90 or less than 10 are good scores, scores between 40 and 50 are okay, and all other scores aren't good at all.

### Skills
- User user input to combine both names and use `lower()` to simplify calculations.
- Use `count()` to count the occurrence of letters within a string.
- Cast the two scores as `strings` to `concatenate` them:
    - true = 1
    - count = 1
    - friendship score = 11, not 2.
- Use the keywords `and` & `or` to create `conditionals` for the friendship scores.
- Print out the friendship scores using a `f-string` and their description.
