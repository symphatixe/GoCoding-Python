# BMI 2.0 Calculator
The purpose of this task is to enhance the BMI calculator that we created before so that we can implement conditionals.

### Skills
  - Use Python notation `**` for exponents.
  - Use `//` to indicate floor division and use `round()`.
  - Use `conditionals` and `relational operators` to print out statements based on the BMI using an `f-string`.
