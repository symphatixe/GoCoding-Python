#TODO create three booleans to store the conditions of the year using modulo by 4, 100, 400
#TODO create a set of conditionals, that states whether the year is a leap year or not using an f-string
"""
#TODO conditions to create:
    - if the year is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year
    - if the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, it is a leap year
    - if the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400, it is not a leap year
    - if the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 and divisible by 400, it is a leap year
