# Write your code below!

#TODO Create a match case that will print either "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or N/A
#TODO For numbers that are divisible by 3 is Fizz, by 5 is Buzz, and by both is FizzBuzz
#TODO Use guard conditions to check the divisibility and print the according text

# TODO Complete the tasks below!
"""
» Using match case, print "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or "N/A"
    › Fizz divisible by 3
    › Buzz divisible by 5
    › FizzBuzz divisible by 3 and 5
    › N/A if neither such as 7
» Use guard conditions to check for the divisibility of a number
» Print the number using an f-string
