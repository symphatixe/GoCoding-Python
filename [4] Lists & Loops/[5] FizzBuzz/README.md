### Skills
- Use user input to determine which of the four possible outcomes should be printed:
    - `Fizz` if divisible by 3
    - `Buzz` if divisible by 5
    - `FizzBuzz` if divisible by both 3 and 5
    - `N/A` or whatever other text is chosen to indicate the number is not one of the matched outcomes
