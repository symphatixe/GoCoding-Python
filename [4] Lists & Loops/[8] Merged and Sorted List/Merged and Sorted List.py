import random

num2 = int(input("How many numbers do you want inside the second list?\n"))


# Write your code below!

#TODO Create two empty lists to store the numbers we will generate
#TODO Using for loops we will generate numbers from 0 - 9 and append them to the lists
#TODO Print both lists using an f-string, then combine both into another list
#TODO Use the sort() function to sort the third list and print it using an f-string
