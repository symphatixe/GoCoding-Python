# Write your code below!

#TODO Create a function that takes three parameters
# one parameter for height, weight, and coverage
#TODO In the function, find the area and then find the amount of paint cans that are needed for this area.
#TODO Use the ceil() function find the minimum amount of cans required
#TODO Call the function using positional parameters and print the amount of cans required.
