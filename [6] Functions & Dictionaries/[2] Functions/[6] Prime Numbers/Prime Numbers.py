» Create a function named is_prime that will take a number as a parameter
» Inside the function create a boolean that will store true/false based on prime
    › Using a for loop check for every number from 2 to number - 1 for remainder
    › If any of the numbers has a remainder, then the number cannot be prime
» Print out whether the number is prime or not prime using an f-string
» Call the function at the end to use it :D
