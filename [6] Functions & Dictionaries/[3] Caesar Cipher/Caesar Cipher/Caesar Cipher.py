# Starter Code
alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']

# Write your code below

#TODO Import the logo of caesar cipher from the art.py file
#TODO Create a function called caesar that will combine both encode and decode into one
#TODO Determine what shift to apply depending on the operation
# Example: If operation is encode + shift, decode is - shift
#TODO To change the shift check for the operation decode since it is going to use a negative
#TODO Using a for loop, start encoding the text using the shift and check for the existence of
# characters inside the alphabet, adding a shifted letter or a space
#TODO Print the completed text using an f-string
#TODO Use a while loop to let the user keep on using the program over and over checking whether
# the user wants to continue using input()

#NOTE: It is important to make sure the shift is properly checked for since there are only so many letters
