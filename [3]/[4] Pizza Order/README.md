# Pizza Order
The purpose of this task is to use user input to create a pizza order and print out the total bill.

### Skills
- Understand the implementation of user input within a program and updating a global variable.
- There are 2 solutions that cover different aspects of programming such as:
  - using multiple conditionals and printing by interweaving input() in between print() statements
  - using a global counter variable to calculate the total
  - use exit() to make sure the user enters the correct data
  - encapsulating conditionals efficiently
  - setting lower() globally on variables to avoid repeating code
