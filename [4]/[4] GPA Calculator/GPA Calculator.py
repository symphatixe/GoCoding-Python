# Starter Code
grades = [90, 60, 90, 40, 50, 100, 70, 40]


# Write your code below!

#TODO Introduce the user to the program and print out the current list of grades using an f-string.
#TODO Calculate the total and the average using the individual indexes of the list, and round the average using the round() function
# lastly printing it as an f-string.
#TODO You took a test and got another 100 on it, 2nd test grade got dropped, last grade did not count since it was a practice exam, 
# insert a new 3rd test grade by using insert() and append() according to the text above
#TODO Use remove() and pop() and understand the difference between them in removing using the different functions
#TODO Use the pop() function by itself and along with a parameter and see the difference in how it works
#TODO Lastly, recalculate the average using indexes and round the average, printing out the final grades and average using an f-string
