#TODO Make sure the variables are set to lower() globally
#TODO Create a function to check the user's choice for a photo
#TODO Using match case change the variable, update the total and print it out
#TODO Create a conditional to print out whether they chose a photo or not and the proper total
#TODO For the photo, implement the same logic to figure out who wants a photo.
#TODO Create simple exceptions using else and exit() to stop the program running on invalid input
