# FizzBuzz 
The purpose of this task is to recreate the simple and infamous FizzBuzz problem.

### Skills
- Use a for loop to loop over numbers 1 - 100 to determine which of the three possible outcomes should be printed:
    - `Fizz` if divisible by 3
    - `Buzz` if divisible by 5
    - `FizzBuzz` if divisible by both 3 and 5
- Use conditionals and nested conditionals to determine which condition fits.
- Another difficulty meter, is to allow user input to determine an outcome based on the user input.
- Use casting to print out the number or use formatted strings.
