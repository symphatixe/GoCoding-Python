# Starter Code
print("Welcome to add evens!")
total = 0


# Write your code below!

#TODO Create a for loop that runs from 0 to 100
#TODO There are two possible solutions: the use of step in the loop and the use of a conditional 
# with modulo division
#TODO Add the even number to the total variable and print out the total using an f-string
