# Average Height
The purpose of this task is to obtain the average score of an array using a loop.

### Skills
- Use `list` along with a `loop` and understand how it works together.
- Use a `counter` and `accumulator variable` to obtain the total and compute the average without using methods such as `sum()` or `len()`.
- Print the average using `round()` using an `f-string`
