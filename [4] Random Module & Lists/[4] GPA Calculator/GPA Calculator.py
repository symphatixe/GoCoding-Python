grades = [90, 60, 90, 40, 50, 100, 70, 40]

#TODO Introduce the user to the program and print out the current list of grades using an f-string.
#TODO Calculate the total and the average using the individual indexes of the list, and round the average using the round() function
# lastly printing it as an f-string.
